Please **improve/refactor** this application. Next list of function signatures that are called
from `order_processing.php` should not be changed.

- `Order::setName`
- `Order::setItems`
- `Order::setTotalAmount`
- `OrderProcessor::process`

We will call `order_processing.php` and we expect same output format in file `result`

Program is executed by calling `php order_processing.php`
